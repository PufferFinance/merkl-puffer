# Welcome to Merkl Lite !

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Remix](https://remix.run/docs)

## Installation

1. Go to `cd packages/dappkit`
2. `git submodule init`
3. `git submodule update`
4. `bun i`
5. `cd ../..`
6. `bun i`
7. `bun dev`

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
bun dev
```


## Deployment

### Host with Docker (recommended)

First you will need to build and push the image to a docker registry

1. Setup a Docker registry if you don't have one (on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) for example)
2. Go to the root of this repository
3. Build the docker container: `docker build --tag <REGISTRY_URL>/merkl-lite:latest .`
4. Push it to your registry: `docker push <REGISTRY_URL>/merkl-lite:latest`

Now you will need to deploy the container, here are a few hosting solutions:

- [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) on Google Cloud
- [ECS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html) on AWS
- Docker-compose on any VM

Then you only need to set the PORT environment variable and it will work! We recommend setting the port to 5173 (it is exposed in the Dockerfile) but feel free to change it.

### Host it yourself

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
